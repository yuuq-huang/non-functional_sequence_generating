# non-functional_sequence_generating
An algorithm that can generate sets of non-repetitive, nonfunctional, and orthogonal sequences fulfilling the user-defined constraints efficiently.<br/>
The algorithm generates non-repetitive sequences with a k-mer counting method and then the sequences generated are checked whether they fulfill the specifications.<br/>
Main function locates in maker_trie.py. Constraints can be accessed by the dictionary constraints.<br/>
Front-end codes are in the front-end folder.<br/>
